# CS432 Final Project by Jason Kim and Harvey Xia
### Computer Music: Sound Synthesis, Spring 2014

### Abstract

We sought to implement various sound effects using signal
functions. Our approach placed a greater emphasis on theoretical and technical
fidelity to the effects as they were conceived and implemented in hardware as
well as on aesthetics. We've included code at the end of the file to showcase
each of our effects as rendered in a wav file.
